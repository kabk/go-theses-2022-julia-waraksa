# MARCH 1, 2022

The geographic site of Babyn Yar, after eighty years believed to finally have reached a fixed state, was once again disturbed when on this day [a missile launched by the Russian Army fell on the TV tower](#figure "Denazification bomb falls in vicinity of Holocaust memorial site")located at the site. The disturbance of this missile created a crater in the soil and dispersed a multitude of shards. Additionally, five people were killed within the vicinity of the impact. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to the tragedy: 
<div class="quote quote-no-padding centered-text">

 To the world: what is the point of saying “never again” for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar? At least five killed. History repeating…[^15]

</div>

The nearest memorials on site, located at approximately 300 metres from the TV tower, were later confirmed still to be intact.[^16] But the memory of Babyn Yar is not so much deposited in the memorials that stand above the ground. It is the ground itself, the elastic movement of the soil caused both by humans as well as the agency of the earth, that over the course of time reveal the multitude of horrific events that occurred on this site. With excavations and forensic reading impossible, the reading of the history of the site depends on cartography and cartographic reconstruction, photographic archives, witness testimonies or other [sonic imaging technologies](#tooltip "The localization of sound sources in three-dimensional space"). Maps drawn in different years have demonstrated the changing landscape, each movement following the massacre creating a disturbance to the victims who were killed there. The events currently unfolding in the vicinity of the park force yet another cartographic layer upon the site. Yet it is one that is, at this moment, still actively unfolding. Layer after layer creates a site most complex and intertwined, the current events multiplying the historical atrocities.

## A history of erasure
Babyn Yar is the name ascribed to the site of the largest killing in Kyiv, Ukraine, that happened on September 29 and September 30 in 1941, eradicating the capital’s entire Jewish population over the span of two days.[^17] Often termed “Holocaust by Bullets”, Babyn Yar is symbolic to the “forgotten” victims of the Holocaust: 2.5 million individuals who were not systematically killed in concentration camps, but instead were hastily shot and buried in mass graves all around Eastern Europe. In the years following the massacre, other groups such as Jews, Roma, underground fighters, the mentally ill and Ukrainian nationalists were brought to this site to be shot and killed in the ravines. In total, an estimated 100.000 to 150.000 people lost their lives at Babyn Yar. Due to the lack of posthumous registry, exact figures are impossible to conclude and rely on estimations of local populace, historians and researchers of the site.

The original geography of the site resembled a large pit; [large, naturally formed ravines](#figure "Ravines of Babyn Yar") that had been on the outskirts of Kyiv. A landscape that lent itself to be utilized by the perpetrators. The violence initiated during the National Socialist (Nazi) occupation had opened up a pathway of permanent, unrecognizable alterations to the site. After the first Jewish killings by the Nazis, Russian Prisoners of War (POWs) were ordered to staple the bodies in the ravines and then to level the soil out to the surface. It was the first step of many to come, in attempt to erase Babyn Yar from the collective memory. When in 1943 the Soviet troops were nearing Kyiv, the Nazis made a hasty attempt to clear out the evidence they had buried in the ground. The POWs were ordered to unearth the remains in order to incinerate them. According to witness testimony, the fire burned for two days to reach the bottom of the grave.[^18] Rendered to ashes, most of the physical traces of the massacre were virtually obliterated. The memory now leaned only on the testimony of survivors, witnesses and records – all vulnerable to incompleteness (of memory), political manipulation or human error. The idea of large-scale excavations to retrieve material witnesses became practically absurd.[^19]

## Erasure as a Political Tool
The Soviets, who had liberated Kyiv, by the ethos of their collective and homogenous idea of history did not formally recognize (ethnic) minorities and therefore had no interest to publicly acknowledge their losses at Babyn Yar.[^20] But the collective loss, raw in its grief, survived in the living memory of those after. Survivors, witnesses, relatives and sympathizers would gather around the site to mourn. The Soviets preferred to erase the site and made further attempts to bury it under a landfill. Later, the site was filled with liquid waste by the neighboring brick factories.

“Science goes fast and straight in its path ; but collective representations do not follow, they are centuries back, kept stagnant in error by power, the mass press and the values of order.” <br>(Barthes et al. 60-63) 
</div>

The master plan was to drain the waste in order for the remaining mud and pulp to fill the ravine, and thus flatten it out evenly. The site literally was attempted to be physically erased by filling it, masking it, by altering the landscape and surface. But on March 12, 1961, due to heavy rain and pump failure, the dam at the station failed. The next morning, four million cubic meters of waste, mud and human remains that had been dumped into the site  broke through towards the neighboring Kurenivka district, [creating a tsunami](#figure "Aftermath of the Kurenivka mudslide")that would destroy everything in its path.[^21] The incident claimed the estimated lives of 145 victims, whose cause of death was suppressed by the authorities, forbidding any mention of the mudslide.[^22] Some people called the flood “the revenge of those shot” in Babyn Yar. [Monument to the victims of the 1961 Kurenivka mudslide](#figure "Monument to the Kurenivka Mudslide"). After the mudslide, the site was again levelled out. The once steep ravines became small hills, overgrown with trees, grass fields and shrubs.

The landscape of Babyn Yar was once a natural and undisturbed site formed over thousands of years by the movements of the earth. But within the span of a mere 20 years, its geographic processes had repeatedly been hastened by human interference, impelled by violence. Excavations, fires, pumping of water and subsequent displacement of mud, soil, shrubs, bushes and trees. Each of these stages were documented not in the earth’s strata, for it happened too fast and too violently to be inscribed into the earth, but in the archives of human memory. 

<div class="half-height">

# And he said, What hast thou done?  
# The voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. 
[Genesis 4:10](#figure "A stone inscription at the site of Babyn Yar")

</div>

Invisible to the eye, the memory of the site had been formally neglected up until 1966 when a series of protests erupted in demand for a memorial. It took a decade until later the Soviets acquiesced and erected a national monument. But it was not to serve the minorities. The inscription on the monument reads: “For the commemoration of the ‘Kyiv residents and prisoners of war’ murdered by the ‘German fascists invaders’” – an umbrella term. Moreover, the monument stands not on the approximate site of the former ravine, but in a small park in a carved-out hill that is separated from the former ravines by a busy road. Observing the monument, people standing in front of the statue become mere miniatures. The statue itself impresses only by its sheer size, for it is a fact that the people who died here did not live to become part of the Soviet Union. Whose citizens then are we commemorating here? [Monument to Soviet citizens and prisoners of war executed by the firing squad in Babyn Yar](#figure "Monument to Soviet citizens and prisoners of war"). The oppression of the Soviet Union sought to rewrite the history, to reclaim the past, of both of the living and the deceased.

</div>

In this line, the function of the memorial becomes to fuse every fallen citizen with the identity of the nation, for which the death of the individual serves as a pledge.  The fluidity of history, multiplicity of events and perspectives becomes ossified in a form that is officially accepted, rendering the monument as the only acceptable vision into the past. The monument becomes not a metallic and long-lasting obituary, but a political tool that is used in order to amplify a specific voice while silencing the others. The losses are reappropriated as national losses. This cruel act only further emphasizes the exclusion of the minorities in the building of a national identity.  Therefore, the monument could be considered unbuilt, and an appropriate honoring of the victims would be for this monument not to be marked as “the first to commemorate the events of Babyn Yar” as it still is termed in 2021.

## Is forgiveness desirable?
When the Soviet Union fell in 1991, the Jewish community grasped the new-found independence to step forward in demand for a Jewish memorial. Subsequently, a[menorah statue](#figure "Menorah Memorial to the Jewish Victims of Babyn Yar")was erected upon a small hill. By doing so, the Jewish community had essentially opened up a blueprint for the site; other minorities followed to finally lay their claim for a memorial. In 2012,[a monument](#figure "Vardo in Memory of Romani executed in Babyn Yar")to commemorate the Sinti and Roma killed during Babi Yar was brought from another location in the city into the park. With no one to formally oversee the site, many others would soon follow. Here and there, small memorials appeared in the park, though many of them were left unfinished due to lack of funding or dispute.

Gradually, the memorial landscape of Babyn Yar became more and more disjointed. Rather than binding together as by common fate, the memorials served to establish their separate identities by fixating on their differences. Each monument, surrounded by shrubs and trees, stands in isolation. There is nothing to bind them but a blind path forward. With the memorials [scattered over the park](#figure 'Figure'), one quickly experiences the feeling of entering a maze. The navigation becomes overwhelming as the path at times becomes unclear; different timelines overlay. In the [December landscape](#figure 'The Soviet memorial at Babyn Yar in December'), mud and snow obliterates the footsteps of those who passed here before. A hill leads to another, which then leads to a closed fence – a dead end – up, backwards and repeat again.

## 80 Years of Silence
In 2016, the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center Foundation (BHMYC) was established. Since its foundation, it terms itself an educational institution which aims to broaden and sustain the memory of the Holocaust in Eastern Europe. Essentially, BHYMC symbolizes the site of Babyn Yar as the shared losses of the greater region. Besides the plans for a large-scale Holocaust museum, the foundation builds and funds other memorial projects on site, including many installations, memorial days, international competitions and memorial performances. By the use of cartographic reconstruction,  the BHYMC after 79 years has the exact locations of the mass killings on September 29 and 30, 1941. The ravine has been reconstructed in a [3D model](#figure 'Figure'), which then was overlayed using photographic footage, paying particular notice to geographic landmarks (a lone tree)] and the positioning of the sun.
