# MARCH 1, 2022

The geographic site of Babyn Yar, after eighty years believed to finally have reached a fixed state, was once again disturbed when on this day [a missile launched by the Russian Army fell on the TV tower](#figure "Denazification bomb falls in vicinity of Holocaust memorial site")located at the site. The disturbance of this missile created a crater in the soil and dispersed a multitude of shards. Additionally, five people were killed within the vicinity of the impact. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to the tragedy: 
<div class="quote quote-no-padding centered-text">

 To the world: what is the point of saying “never again” for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar? At least five killed. History repeating…[^15]

</div>

The nearest memorials on site, located at approximately 300 metres from the TV tower, were later confirmed still to be intact.[^16] But the memory of Babyn Yar is not so much deposited in the memorials that stand above the ground. It is the ground itself, the elastic movement of the soil caused both by humans as well as the agency of the earth, that over the course of time reveal the multitude of horrific events that occurred on this site. With excavations and forensic reading impossible, the reading of the history of the site depends on cartography and cartographic reconstruction, photographic archives, witness testimonies or other [sonic imaging technologies](#tooltip "The localization of sound sources in three-dimensional space"). Maps drawn in different years have demonstrated the changing landscape, each movement following the massacre creating a disturbance to the victims who were killed there. The events currently unfolding in the vicinity of the park force yet another cartographic layer upon the site. Yet it is one that is, at this moment, still actively unfolding. Layer after layer creates a site most complex and intertwined, the current events multiplying the historical atrocities.

## A history of erasure
Babyn Yar is the name ascribed to the site of the largest killing in Kyiv, Ukraine, that happened on September 29 and September 30 in 1941, eradicating the capital’s entire Jewish population over the span of two days.[^17] Often termed “Holocaust by Bullets”, Babyn Yar is symbolic to the “forgotten” victims of the Holocaust: 2.5 million individuals who were not systematically killed in concentration camps, but instead were hastily shot and buried in mass graves all around Eastern Europe. In the years following the massacre, other groups such as Jews, Roma, underground fighters, the mentally ill and Ukrainian nationalists were brought to this site to be shot and killed in the ravines. In total, an estimated 100.000 to 150.000 people lost their lives at Babyn Yar. Due to the lack of posthumous registry, exact figures are impossible to conclude and rely on estimations of local populace, historians and researchers of the site.

The original geography of the site resembled a large pit; [large, naturally formed ravines](#figure "Ravines of Babyn Yar") that had been on the outskirts of Kyiv. A landscape that lent itself to be utilized by the perpetrators. The violence initiated during the National Socialist (Nazi) occupation had opened up a pathway of permanent, unrecognizable alterations to the site. After the first Jewish killings by the Nazis, Russian Prisoners of War (POWs) were ordered to staple the bodies in the ravines and then to level the soil out to the surface. It was the first step of many to come, in attempt to erase Babyn Yar from the collective memory. When in 1943 the Soviet troops were nearing Kyiv, the Nazis made a hasty attempt to clear out the evidence they had buried in the ground. The POWs were ordered to unearth the remains in order to incinerate them. According to witness testimony, the fire burned for two days to reach the bottom of the grave.[^18] Rendered to ashes, most of the physical traces of the massacre were virtually obliterated. The memory now leaned only on the testimony of survivors, witnesses and records – all vulnerable to incompleteness (of memory), political manipulation or human error. The idea of large-scale excavations to retrieve material witnesses became practically absurd.[^19]

## Erasure as a Political Tool
The Soviets, who had liberated Kyiv, by the ethos of their collective and homogenous idea of history did not formally recognize (ethnic) minorities and therefore had no interest to publicly acknowledge their losses at Babyn Yar.[^20] But the collective loss, raw in its grief, survived in the living memory of those after. Survivors, witnesses, relatives and sympathizers would gather around the site to mourn. The Soviets preferred to erase the site and made further attempts to bury it under a landfill. Later, the site was filled with liquid waste by the neighboring brick factories. 

<div class="quote">
“Science goes fast and straight in its path ; but collective representations do not follow, they are centuries back, kept stagnant in error by power, the mass press and the values of order.” <br>(Barthes et al. 60-63) 
</div>

The master plan was to drain the waste in order for the remaining mud and pulp to fill the ravine, and thus flatten it out evenly. The site literally was attempted to be physically erased by filling it, masking it, by altering the landscape and surface. But on March 12, 1961, due to heavy rain and pump failure, the dam at the station failed. The next morning, four million cubic meters of waste, mud and human remains that had been dumped into the site  broke through towards the neighboring Kurenivka district, [creating a tsunami](#figure "Aftermath of the Kurenivka mudslide")that would destroy everything in its path.[^21] The incident claimed the estimated lives of 145 victims, whose cause of death was suppressed by the authorities, forbidding any mention of the mudslide.[^22] Some people called the flood “the revenge of those shot” in Babyn Yar.[^23] [Monument to the victims of the 1961 Kurenivka mudslide](#figure "Monument to the Kurenivka Mudslide"). After the mudslide, the site was again levelled out. The once steep ravines became small hills, overgrown with trees, grass fields and shrubs.

The landscape of Babyn Yar was once a natural and undisturbed site formed over thousands of years by the movements of the earth. But within the span of a mere 20 years, its geographic processes had repeatedly been hastened by human interference, impelled by violence. Excavations, fires, pumping of water and subsequent displacement of mud, soil, shrubs, bushes and trees. Each of these stages were documented not in the earth’s strata, for it happened too fast and too violently to be inscribed into the earth, but in the archives of human memory. 

<div class="half-height">

# And he said, What hast thou done?  
# The voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. 
[Genesis 4:10](#figure "A stone inscription at the site of Babyn Yar")

</div>

Invisible to the eye, the memory of the site had been formally neglected up until 1966 when a series of protests erupted in demand for a memorial. It took a decade until later the Soviets acquiesced and erected a national monument. But it was not to serve the minorities. The inscription on the monument reads: “For the commemoration of the ‘Kyiv residents and prisoners of war’ murdered by the ‘German fascists invaders’” – an umbrella term. Moreover, the monument stands not on the approximate site of the former ravine, but in a small park in a carved-out hill that is separated from the former ravines by a busy road. Observing the monument, people standing in front of the statue become mere miniatures. The statue itself impresses only by its sheer size, for it is a fact that the people who died here did not live to become part of the Soviet Union. Whose citizens then are we commemorating here? [Monument to Soviet citizens and prisoners of war executed by the firing squad in Babyn Yar](#figure "Monument to Soviet citizens and prisoners of war"). The oppression of the Soviet Union sought to rewrite the history, to reclaim the past, of both of the living and the deceased.

<div class="img-container">

          <div class="img-caption">
          
 Figure 1 Stolpersteine
</div>          
</div>

In this line, the function of the memorial becomes to fuse every fallen citizen with the identity of the nation, for which the death of the individual serves as a pledge.[^24] The fluidity of history, multiplicity of events and perspectives becomes ossified in a form that is officially accepted, rendering the monument as the only acceptable vision into the past. The monument becomes not a metallic and long-lasting obituary, but a political tool that is used in order to amplify a specific voice while silencing the others. The losses are reappropriated as national losses. This cruel act only further emphasizes the exclusion of the minorities in the building of a national identity.  Therefore, the monument could be considered unbuilt, and an appropriate honoring of the victims would be for this monument not to be marked as “the first to commemorate the events of Babyn Yar” as it still is termed in 2021.

<br><br>

## Is forgiveness desirable?
When the Soviet Union fell in 1991, the Jewish community grasped the new-found independence to step forward in demand for a Jewish memorial. Subsequently, a[menorah statue](#figure "Menorah Memorial to the Jewish Victims of Babyn Yar")was erected upon a small hill. By doing so, the Jewish community had essentially opened up a blueprint for the site; other minorities followed to finally lay their claim for a memorial. In 2012,[a monument](#figure "Vardo in Memory of Romani executed in Babyn Yar")to commemorate the Sinti and Roma killed during Babi Yar was brought from another location in the city into the park. With no one to formally oversee the site, many others would soon follow. Here and there, small memorials appeared in the park, though many of them were left unfinished due to lack of funding or dispute. 

<div class="img-container">

</div>

Gradually, the memorial landscape of Babyn Yar became more and more disjointed. Rather than binding together as by common fate, the memorials served to establish their separate identities by fixating on their differences. Each monument, surrounded by shrubs and trees, stands in isolation. There is nothing to bind them but a blind path forward. With the memorials [scattered over the park](#figure 'Figure'), one quickly experiences the feeling of entering a maze. The navigation becomes overwhelming as the path at times becomes unclear; different timelines overlay. In the [December landscape](#figure 'The Soviet memorial at Babyn Yar in December'), mud and snow obliterates the footsteps of those who passed here before. A hill leads to another, which then leads to a closed fence – a dead end – up, backwards and repeat again. 

<br><br>

## 80 Years of Silence
In 2016, the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center Foundation (BHMYC) was established. Since its foundation, it terms itself an educational institution which aims to broaden and sustain the memory of the Holocaust in Eastern Europe. Essentially, BHYMC symbolizes the site of Babyn Yar as the shared losses of the greater region. Besides the plans for a large-scale Holocaust museum, the foundation builds and funds other memorial projects on site, including many installations, memorial days, international competitions and memorial performances. By the use of cartographic reconstruction,  the BHYMC after 79 years has the exact locations of the mass killings on September 29 and 30, 1941. The ravine has been reconstructed in a [3D model](#figure '3D Model Babyn Yar Ravine'), which then was overlayed using photographic footage, paying particular notice to geographic landmarks (a lone tree)] and the positioning of the sun.[^25]

In stark contrast to the lack of commemoration over the preceding period of 79 years, the haste of the BHYMC foundation is remarkable. In September 2021, on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of Babyn Yar, multiple installations and monuments were revealed. [The Crystal Wall of Crying](#figure 'The Crystal Wall of Crying') is a 40-meter long structure with extruding rock quartz crystals by  Marina Abramović, the world-renowned performance artist of Serbian origin. [A place for reflection](#figure 'A Place for Reflection') – a foldable, wooden synagogue by Manuel Herz, an Austrian architecture bureau.[^26] [Mound of Memory](#figure 'Mound of Memory or Museum of the History of the Tragedy'), representing a [kurgan](#tooltip 'A Kurgan is a historical type of burial, constituted of a mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves. It was popularised in its use by Soviet archaeology.'), or the Museum of the History of the Tragedy designed by SUB, a German architecture bureau. Later, in January 2022, the BHYMC launches the [Babyn Yar Masterplan Open Ideas Competition](#figure 'Babyn Yar Masterplan Open Ideas Competition'), launched for the development of an artistic plan of “how to connect the scattered memories of the park” and “make it one cohesive experience and story”.[^27]

<br><br>

## Political motivations
One cannot help but wonder behind the motives for both the haste and the excessive funding: a sum of approximately $100 million, the largest ever such funding for a Holocaust memorial project. The funding is secured by famous and prestigious figures in Ukraine, as well a significant few of which (Jewish) businessmen with close ties to Russia. Participation in such a project almost guarantees a certain level of prestige, thus local media are not shy to scrutinize the supporters of the organization. Some journalists infamously term the educational center “Putin’s Trojan Horse,” for at the current height of the hybrid war between Russia and Ukraine, the influence of Russian funding risks to affect the autonomy of the center, allowing for tampering with historical facts or the eschewing of the facts altogether.  Critics fear that the narrative pursued by the center, in order to secure the funding, may highlight the participation of Ukrainian Nazi collaborators whilst diverting from the fact that the Soviet Union, by the agreements of the historic Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, was equally complicit to the Nazis for forming the conditions that allowed many of the crimes to occur in first place.  One public demand is for the BHYMC’s rights to the future of the park to be more distributed in order to leave place for smaller, not lesser significant, local initiatives and artistic figures. Yet with little effect – the BHYMC still holds the decisive say over the site.

One of the BHYMC’s projects, [The Mirror Field](#figure 'The Mirror Field'), is a newly erected audiovisual monument placed in the midst of an abandoned soccer field. One of the columns blends with the TV tower in the back.[^30] The informative plaque dates 2021, exactly 80 years after the massacre. Representing the Kabbalah, the Tree of Life, the monument consists of 10 metal columns shot through by bullets.[^31] The material is of a glossy steel which reflects like a mirror – looking into the columns, ones face is distorted by the deformations caused by the bullet holes. The icy floor trembles as a multiple voices sing a Yiddish song, coming out of the bullet holes. The reverberations give off an eerie impression, as if the ground is alive, a faint heart beating. No number is ascribed to the monument – from the plaque in front, it is unclear whether the installation is temporary. Could this monument, too, in x years become simply another ruin as many of the former ones on site?

<div class="quote">

The Monument, as an object of public memory in the post-historical age, becomes an impossible object. And more precisely, if it does exist, it is rather a monument to oblivion than to remembrance; rather an object that threatens than one upon which our gaze can calmly rest so as to experience it as the screen of (a) memory which hides the trauma to which it is dedicated. Moreover, the monument is a trauma for-itself and in-itself.<br>Stojanovic, <u>The Case of the Belgrade Monument</u>[^32]  

</div>

The foundation admits to the controversy regarding the erection of new monuments and memorials, most of which will require a foundations to be built into the soil, thus once again tampering with the geographic site. How can one justify further disturbance, keeping respect to the ground that, being a mass burial of Jews, is considered holy by Jewish tradition?  As the last generation who witnessed and survived Babyn Yar is nearing death, what could be a lasting, appropriate body for their stories to inhabit – one that does not require further disturbance of the sacred soil?[^33] If memory, in order to progress must continuously negate itself, should memorials too be temporal, rather than something eternally ossified in concrete? If not, how can collective and individual histories interact and permeate each other on the shared grounds of a public memorial? Whose voice should be amplified, and who has the agency to decide? The commemorative park of Babyn Yar is visibly still in progress, and the local community, including those of direct and indirect survivors, is struggling to find unity over its commemoration. It is as though each attempt to suture the deep wounds of Babyn Yar, does not accomplish to initiate any healing process. Instead it appears that these attempts each create more conflict in the narration of Babyn Yar as each for their own decide who, and what, is most important to remember. 

<br><br>

## The Formation of Elastic Memory
It is this crack, this open wound, this rupture that makes visible the entangled controversial histories of this specific site. Through the crack in the soil the unfolding events become visible and in the site of crime one can discover and read the trajectories of the events. The mud slide, that is the earth’s motion, as well as human’s actions and attempts to erase any genocide are overlapping here as different layers, that meshed together become a toxic layer of attempting to cover the heights of human atrocity, and to prevent any reading of the site or any commemoration to come in the future. 

It is almost cynical that the rupture of the earth’s crust’s and the motion of a slide of mud would have been an accomplice in the erasure of the memory of the people who were killed at this specific site. As was the topographical formation of the landscape as mentioned earlier in chapter two. The tragic history of this site emphasizes the agency of the earth, which can be both accomplice and adversary to human intentions. In the case of Babyn Yar, with human intentions geared fully towards destruction, the disturbance to the soil became accomplice to suffering. A suffering that is of a deep, invisible wound – a hidden ravine symbolically. Equated with its own erasure, the suffering becomes a suffering that cannot be quelled. The erasure of the site by burning, burial and a mudslide disinhibits from any possibility of forensic reading. 

But can the human interference of geographic site be reverted from destruction and into creation? The earth itself as it moves, destroys in order to create. Forest fires remove low-growing thicket, clean the forest floors, open them up to sunlight and nourish the soil, allowing established trees to grow healthier. Even at Babyn Yar, the forests returned and the shrubs grew back stronger and healthier. But they had to be removed first. In this case, metallic memory, inserted into a geographic landscape, negates itself from the moment of its conception. It is built to withstand time: it resists the natural processes of destruction, and therefore, also those of creation. What if monuments could move together with the earth?
