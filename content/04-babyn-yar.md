# MARCH 3, 2022

The geographic site of Babyn Yar, after eighty years believed to finally have reached a fixed state, was once again disturbed when on the 1st of March 2022 a missile fell on the TV tower located at the site. The disturbance of this missile created a crater in the soil and dispersed a multitude of shards. Additionally, five people were killed within the vicinity of the impact. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to the tragedy: “To the world: what is the point of saying “never again” for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar? At least 5 killed. History repeating…” 

The nearest memorials on site, located at approximately 300m from the TV tower, were later revealed not be intact.  But the memory of Babyn Yar is not so much deposited in the memorials that stand above the ground. It is the ground itself, the elastic movement of the soil caused both by humans as well as the agency of the earth, that over the course of time reveal the multitude of horrific events. With excavations and forensic reading impossible, the reading of the history of the site depends on cartography and cartographic reconstruction, photographic archives and witness testimonies. Maps drawn in different years have demonstrated the changing landscape, each movement following the massacre creating a disturbance to the victims who were killed there. The events currently unfolding in the vicinity of the park force yet another cartographic layer upon the site. Yet it is one that is, at this moment, still actively unfolding.

## A history of erasure
Babyn Yar is the name ascribed to the site of the largest killing in Kyiv, Ukraine, that happened on September 29 and September 30 in 1941, eradicating the capital’s entire Jewish population over the span of two days.  Often termed “Holocaust by Bullets”, Babyn Yar is symbolic to the “forgotten” victims of the Holocaust: 2.5 million individuals who were not systematically killed in concentration camps, but instead were hastily shot and buried in mass graves all around Eastern Europe. In the years following the massacre, other groups such as Jews, Roma, underground fighters, the mentally ill and Ukrainian nationalists were brought to this site to be shot and killed in the ravines. In total, an estimated 100.000 to 150.000 people lost their lives at Babyn Yar. Due to the lack of posthumous registry, exact figures are impossible to conclude and rely on estimations of local populace, historians and researchers of the site.

The original geography of the site resembled a large pit; large, naturally formed ravines that had been on the outskirts of Kyiv. But the violence initiated during the Nazi occupation had opened up a pathway of permanent, unrecognizable alterations to the site. After the first Jewish killings by the Nazis, Russian POW’s were ordered to staple the bodies in the ravines and then to level them out to the surface. It was the first step of many to come, in attempt to erase Babyn Yar from the collective memory. When in 1943 the Soviet troops were nearing Kyiv, the Nazis made a hasty attempt to clear out the evidence they had buried in the ground. They unearthed the remains in order to incinerate them. According to witness testimony, the fire burned for two days to reach the bottom of the grave.  Rendered to ashes, most of the physical traces of the massacre were virtually obliterated. The memory now leaned only on the testimony of survivors, witnesses and records – all vulnerable to incompleteness (of memory), political manipulation or human error. The idea of large-scale excavations to retrieve material witnesses became practically absurd.
