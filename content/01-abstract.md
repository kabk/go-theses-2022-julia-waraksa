While writing this thesis, Ukraine, which is at the center of one of my chapters described here, was attacked. As of today it is once again an active site of war, and new topographies of violence are being formed.

# Abstract
<br><br>
Topography of Violence places an analogy between individual and collective memory through sites that have witnessed ethnic and historical cleansing. The remembering of these sites, as well as the questioning of what should be their designated influence on our contemporary value system is gaining increasing attention in academic discussion. But ultimately, there is need for the discussion to break free from academia. I believe that looking critically at monuments and what they selectively represent, could be an important way to collectively reconsider the values that we choose to embed in public space. My research question concentrates on how the culture of memorizing and remembering is performed, or purposely not performed, through the site of the incident: by the erection of monuments, the lack thereof, the inadequacy of their representation, or their strategic misrepresentation.

In order to put face to the discussion, this thesis takes a closer look at the case study of the [Babyn Yar](#tooltip "grandmother's ravine (Ukrainian)") Massacre in Ukraine that took place in the year 1941. For the Ukrainians and other minorities who fell victim to this massacre, over the course of 80 years the collective memory of the event has repeatedly been subject to an act of politically motivated forgettance, thereby leaving it to the disjointed, politically- and emotionally-laden discussion that still surrounds its commemoration today. By doing so, I demonstrate that such incidents of loss of a geographic site may result in a disjoined collective identity, therefore I argue that these sites are significant far beyond their regional scale. They must remain precisely because there have been efforts to erase the memories attached to these historical and contested events.
