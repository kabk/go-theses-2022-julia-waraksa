# Formation of Memory

</div>


## Individual Memory
Memory, on the individual level, is the processing of physical sensations into cognition. From the point of departure of our body, memory sets us against who we were in the past and defines us into who we are in the present.[^5] But memory formation also alters us on a physical level. The study of engrams  reveals memories not only as something ephemeral, but rather as something physical that is stored in the brain or in the body.[^6] Metaphorically speaking memories are inscribed into the material tissue of our brain structures, its cells and its cognitive system. But beyond that memories are inscribed into a body memory, on a synaptic level.[^7] Controversial animal trials have shown that even in instances where the brain was unrecognizably altered, meaning that the synapses in the brain were erased completely, the body still held on to associations of previously encountered danger. Fight or flight responses were literally encoded in their body. Similarly, systematically oppressed people show signs of intergenerational trauma through symptoms of heightened alert systems, increased anxiety, hypervigilance and psychiatric disorders.[^8] Consequently, these biological symptoms translate themselves into learnt and ingrained behaviors, beliefs and patterns, allowing the trauma to continue as it takes on a subconscious position in the brain.

## To Alter a Memory
The Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) technique is a renowned approach to overcoming subconscious traumatic responses, which express themselves in both emotional and physical upheaval.[^9] While other treatments concentrate on altering the emotional response of a trauma, EMDR concentrates directly on the memory, with the intention to change the manner that it is stored in the brain. With EMDR, the person is asked to evoke a traumatic memory, whilst simultaneously tapping a part of the body or moving the eyes left to right. This technique triggers a bilateral system in the brain. The conscious connecting of the trauma with physical action, such as for example a rhythmic tapping onto a part of the body, deposits the memory externally. It rewires the engram and deposits it into conscious motoric movement. Over the course of this treatment, this process of externalizing the memory allows it to become a memory of the past, one which no longer effectively haunts the present. 

How does individual memory run parallel to the landscape of our collective memory?  Does trauma ingrain itself on physical site, the same way it ingrains itself within our bodies? What then constitutes of a “conscious” disposal of a collective trauma, one that would allow for “effective closure” – a closure that is not leaned on forgetting but on remembering?

          <u>Figure 1</u> The Wall of Sorrow in Moscow, erected in 2017 on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin, commemorates the victims of Soviet repressions. Several words are incised on two big stone slabs standing behind the bronze wall. On one of them are the words “REMEMBER” and “BE AWARE”, and on the other, the words “CONDEMN” and “FORGIVE.” The president’s reasoning for erecting the monument is that “the events must never be forgotten” and “let it be a lesson to future generations”. However, the inscription of “FORGIVE” has garnished intense criticism especially in light of the President recent claims that Stalin’s rule has wrongly been exaggerated –  his crimes against humanity were supposedly “not as severe as portrayed” and can therefore be “forgiven” in the light of moving on and learning from one’s mistakes. The monument is popularly slandered as hypocritical as it mildens the societal impact of Soviet repressions. Who must forgive who, and more importantly, why now, at a late hour?

In the acclaimed book <u>Black Skin, White Masks</u>, Frantz Fanon wrote “I am not a prisoner of History. I must not look for the meaning of my destiny in that direction,” and further,” I show solidarity with humanity provided I can go one step further.”[^10] Fanon, writing from the perspective of the oppressed, sees the formation of an emancipated future only if the chain of the past is broken. Release the history, but remember the violence inflicted. Memory, to be empowering rather than crippling to one’s identity, must harbor this duality; a colonized people must remember grievance and act upon the affect of rage, but they must also be able to forget the grievances produced by the violence, which stifles and frightens them in action.

## Monumental Memory
Traditionally, memorial sites are official narrations of immaterial history, produced by an authoritative party. Memorials resist the renewal of states, politics and power. They exist as a basis upon which a common identity is formed, “cementing” the history, and therefore the identity of a nation or of a people. They are designed to shoulder the weight of the individual memory’s burden by forming generalizations and abstractions that often signify a common fate; essentially, they can be seen as “deposits” of memory. Observing memorials in West Germany, it is noticeable that after the war, many inscriptions were expanded from honoring those who had been in service to the country, to include civilian deaths and later even those who had died in concentration camps. It is here when war and terror became memorized in conjunction, bringing together different identities whose commonality was a shared despairing meaningless. In a spiritual shift of consciousness after the war, memorials gained the purpose of expressing the sympathies towards the loss of a collective identity, rather than the establishment of it.[^11]

But there is a drawback. The less we experience their memory internally, the more the memory begins to exist externally. “The memorial’s new vocation is to record: delegating to the [lieu de memoire](#tooltip "French, place of memory") the responsibility of remembering, it sheds its signs upon depositing them there, as a snake sheds its skin.” (Nora 13) Consequently, the memorial stirs up not feelings of embodied violence but rather feelings of distant sympathy. When one can feel *only* this sympathy, it becomes a signifier of one’s safety: there is no need to fear that one may meet the same fate. And so far as we feel this distant sympathy for the other, we become accomplice to the cause of the suffering, because to set aside this sympathy means to call for a critical reflection of how our privilege is located on the same map of their suffering. In other words, how our sympathy may be linked to their suffering in the same way “as the wealth of some may imply the destitution of others.” (Sontag 55) 

In his essay on what it means to come to terms with the past, the German philosopher Theodor W. Adorno reflects on the troubled post-war memorial culture of Germany. He concludes that “the past will have been worked through only when the causes of what happened then have been eliminated. Only because the causes continue to exist does the captivating spell of the past remain to this day unbroken.” (Adorno 103) By his belief, to come to terms with the past is essentially a matter of how the past is called up and made present: whether it stops at reproach and the use of euphemism, or whether its horrors are endured. The latter requires a certain strength that challenges the cognitive biases and racial prejudices that pave way for otherwise harmful ideologies.[^12]

The intent of a post-war memorial is to remind in order never to allow for the conditions which allowed the violence to come to fruition to repeat. But the farther the memorial deposits itself as a fixed memory in space, the farther the intent of the monument strays from the public. The public response of a desire to “quickly move on from tragedy” is complicit in that it assumes such violence could only arise in the specific set of conditions it was conceived in, and could therefore not take place in the “renewed” society. “When grieving is something to be feared, our fears can give rise to the impulse to resolve it quickly, to banish it in the name of an action invested with the power to restore the loss or return the world to a former order, or to reinvigorate a fantasy that the world formerly was orderly.” (Butler 29–30) Complicit silence assumes that time itself will settle the conflict, whereas in fact, time only distances the struggle. 

The historicity of the human condition requires that practices of power and domination are renewed. Slavery, Colonialism and the Holocaust are “legacies” of that renewal. The struggle of the present, therefore, is one of authenticity; how does the past reside in our present struggles? Our shared authenticity depends on these struggles – “only in that present can we be true or false to the past we choose to acknowledge.” (Trouillot 151) Monumental narration becomes dangerous insofar it promotes and fixates a singular narration of the past, and assume that past to be redeemed. Forgiven.

“When we lose certain people, or when we are dispossessed from a place, or a community, we may simply feel that we are undergoing something temporary, that mourning will be over and some restoration of prior order will be achieved. But maybe when we undergo what we do, something about who we are is revealed, something that delineates the ties we have to others, that shows us that these ties constitute what we are, ties or bonds that compose us.” (Butler, 22)

Therefore, the challenging of our biases in public space is potentially synonymous to the erection of collective memorials not as places of worship or sympathy, but as places that allow for intense self-criticism and self-examination. The landscape of traditional monuments needs the critical countering of anti-monuments – only in the contradiction of their opposing narratives can the struggle actively reside.[^13] Regardless of race, identity or nation, they are to be memorials that represent a place of mourning reach towards our shared conditions: mortality, often senseless mortality inflicted by violence. Reaching towards the banality of evil, a term coined by Hannah Arendt, for these monuments it is not a simple question of who terrorized who, but rather, what are the conditions that allowed for the violence to occur? And are we in our present day complicit to the formation of those very same conditions? As Walter Benjamin writes in <u>On the Concept of History</u>, “We are touched by the same air that was before.”[^14]
