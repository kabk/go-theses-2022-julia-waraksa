# Formation of Memory

It is less than a century ago that we, as humankind, vowed never again to embody the ideals that led to the atrocities of World War II. These memories now seem to belong to the previous century, as if the turning of the millennium marked the turning of a new page. The linear passing of time permits us to speak of the “past” as a fixed entity; we presume that the troubles of the past have resolved as the memory is long laid to rest. The memory becomes settled, buried in facts, cemented in memorials and national days of remembrance. But the farther the memory regresses and the farther we allocate it to a certain site, shape or form – and therefore consider its sociopolitical conditions exclusive to its historical circumstances – the more we diminish its significance in the active forming of our present. Past remains past, as we turn our eyes towards the present and the future. But one cannot exist without the other. One render the past as singular, for that allows for the formation of false narratives. As Simone Weil writes in The Need for Roots, 

<span class="quote">
  It would be useless to turn one’s back on the past in order simply to concentrate on the future. It is a dangerous illusion to believe that such a thing is even possible. The opposition of future to past or past to future is absurd. The future brings us nothing, gives us nothing; it is we who in order to build it have to give it everything, our very life. But to be able to give, one has to possess; and we possess no other life, no other living sap, than the treasures stored up from the past and digested, assimilated and created afresh by us. Of all the human soul’s needs, none is more vital than this one of the past. (Weil 48)
