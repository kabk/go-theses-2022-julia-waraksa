##### Conclusion

</div>

The soil is not solid. It is a living entity. In itself, it appears immobile. But sitting upon the earth’s strata, it moves slowly, sedulously, across time and surface. The soil is porous as the mud bends, collapses and fills into the seams and the cracks. The soil is elastic as it moves and reforms, pushing its structure outwards against the pressures applied by human disturbance. The soil remembers traumatic sites even if you cannot see them. The soil acts as a moving container which moves and shuffles and reshuffles history. The soil as well as history are never static and thus, monuments should never be static. The soil holds a memory, a memory that reveals itself to those who can read and decipher it.

Monuments which commemorate the loss of a people become deposits of memory – concrete, bronzified and metallic memory – which on their own and if not performed become inactive, a “thing from the past” that can only be activated when there is an incentive to do so. They are designed as extensions to carry forward the memory of the site, but they fail to amplify the voice of the earth, as they resist the earth’s destruction. They silence the earth as they call the grief upon themselves. The more such grief becomes embedded in metallic memory, the more it alleviates the viewer of its burden: ones sympathies concentrate on a figure that stands before them, rather than the landscape that surrounds it. In this case, the suturing happens only on the surface. What is omitted in this process is the acknowledgement of the memory that has become embedded in the soil. The hidden, symbolic grief, embedded between the strata of the earth; teardrops, blood, ashes and charred bones.  

Yearly, Babyn Yar is visited by thousands of minorities who come to mourn the ancestors they have lost to the violence. The efforts of the memorial organizations have proved that it is possible to recover a memory deemed erased and to return people a place to mourn. It is therefore important to guard that these memorials remain to be considered as a living being, participating in the discussions that surround them, speaking to the visitors who visit them. It is important to let monuments actively move in a landscape that appears deceptively still. The visitors of the park become living vessels, engaging in points of interaction and carrying the memory forward and onward for generations to come. 

If we wish to have solidified memory shape our future from an active position – i.e. let them become ‘advisors’, ‘warnings’,‘informers’ and ‘landmarks’ – we must not only commemorate them but we must also maintain the piercing pain that its history of violence has inflicted. And it must be as sharp and as immediate as the violence committed to the site, the earth that is the skin’s surface. In Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, <b>Judith Butler</b> writes, “Let's face it. We're undone by each other. And if we're not, we're missing something.”[^35]

To achieve a lasting grief, a solidified memory must become one as if vivid and alive. One that is shaped by, and shapes, the geographic and social landscape that surrounds it – one that pierces it, does not hide and does not quieten. Rachel Whiteread, the artist behind the Judenplatz memorial in Vienna, Austria, commented that she will not protect the memorial with an anti-graffiti coating. In her words, “If someone sprays a swastika on it we can try to scrub it off, but a few daubed swastikas would really make people think about what's happening in their society.” Perhaps it is critical for such sites to remain an open-ended discussion, one that should not be closed in haste as the BHYMC attempts to do so. “To grieve, and to make grief itself into a resource for politics, is not to be resigned to inaction, but it may be understood as the slow process by which we develop a point of identification with suffering itself. The disorientation of grief – “Who have I become?” or, indeed, “What is left of me?” “What is it in the Other that I have lost?” posits the “I” in the mode of unknowingness.” (Butler 30)

When we remember, we remember only fragments which we then subconsciously process into a linear and sensical narrative. But a fragment of another person’s memory, a memory that imparts itself on our own, may reveal a separate and unknown past running parallel to ours. The narrative shifts as it moves and changes into a new order, wholly influencing our conception of both past and present. In order for a memorial site to bring to terms the traumatic past that it commemorates, it must move as our own memory continuously does, revealing and making space to let loose the entanglement of its narratives. Giving trauma a lasting shape in the form of a memorial allows for a depositing of pain. But it is the act of consequently touching upon this pain, animating the soil upon which it stands and re-narrating its history through revealing the multitude of its past, which allows for a closure that leans on remembering – not on forgetting.

Rachel Whiteread, <i>Judenplatz Memorial</i>  (2000) in Vienna, Austria. The monument measures 10 × 7 × 3.8m. It features a library made of concrete books whose spines are shown outwards, therefore, the titles are illegible. It can be understood as the appreciation of Judaism as the religion of the "book" but it demonstrates also a cultural space of memory loss caused by the genocide. The monument sits atop of the remains of a medieval synagogue.
